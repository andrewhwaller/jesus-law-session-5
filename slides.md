# Jesus and the Law of Israel

## Session 4: Can The Leper Change Our Thoughts?

# Ritual impurity
1. Unavoidable, sometimes natural, and part of everyday life.
2. Can be contracted from objects or substances.
3. Can be transmitted to others directly and indirectly.
4. Removed by time, ritual washing, and sometimes sacrifice.
5. ***Not*** sinful! It is not a sin to become ritually impure.

<br/>

# Moral impurity
1. Avoidable.
2. Caused by grave sin, but cannot be spread through social contagion.
3. Pollutes the land of Israel.
4. Typically can be removed via atonement or punishment, but sometimes irremovable.
5. ***Absolutely*** sinful.

# Luke 5:12--14
“Once, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man covered with \[*lepra*\]. When he saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him, ‘Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean.’ Then Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, ‘I do choose. Be made clean.’ Immediately the \[*lepra*\] left him. And he ordered him to tell no one. ‘Go,’ he said, ‘and show yourself to the priest, and, as Moses commanded, make an offering for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.’”

# Five common (and incorrect!) assertions about lepers
* Leprosy (modern-day *Hansen's disease*) was an incurable and severely disfiguring disease.
* Leprosy was contagious and so contact with others was forbidden.
* Lepers were banished from public life and were forced to live outside cities and towns.
* Lepers could not participate in worship or religious life.
* Exclusion was permanent unless certified by a priest.

<!-- 
* Hat tip to Logan Williams for this example of common lepra misconceptions: [GCSE, *Jesus heals ten men with a skin disease*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zhmhcqt/revision/5)
* These are four common misconceptions about lepra that are not supported by historical evidence.
* *Lepra* does not refer to Hansen's disease. In biblical law, *lepra* refers to a variety of skin conditions that do not precisely map onto known pathologies. Close analogues would be psoriasis, eczema, or some form of dermatitis.
* We have no evidence that people with *lepra* were uniformly excluded from society.
* As we'll see, biblical law does not forbid contact with people with *lepra* and the various descriptions in biblical law are not concerned with the possibility of contagion.
* Jesus's touching of lepers does not in any way violate or contravene biblical law.

<!-- 
* Wallace seems to be over-interpreting b. Ned. 64b, here. "As if there were dead" need not be read as some sort of "living death." Re: *lepra*, the reference is to Miriam's *lepra* in Num. 12:12, which sees Aaron reacting to her skin's death-like condition.
* Additionally, the idea of *lepra* as divine punishment doesn't have an explicit presence in biblical law.

# Leviticus 13:2--46
“‘When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling or an eruption or a spot, and it turns into \[*lepra*\], he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests. The priest shall examine...; after the priest has examined him he shall pronounce him \[impure\]\.\.\.\. The person who has \[*lepra*\] shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head be disheveled; and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out, “\[impure, impure\].” He shall remain \[impure\] as long as he has the disease; he is \[impure\]. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be *outside the camp*.’”

# Numbers 5:1--3
“The <sc>Lord</sc> spoke to Moses, saying: ‘Command the Israelites to put out of the camp everyone who is leprous, or has a discharge, and everyone who is unclean through contact with a corpse; you shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp; they must not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.’”

<!--

* What does biblical law say? Three things to note:
    * Priests identify *lepra* by visual appearance, *not medical situation*; *lepra* is that which has the appearance of *death*.
    * *Lepra* transmits ritual impurity in basically the same way as a corpse; discharge, *lepra*, and corpse impurity are addressed as one category.
    * The geography of separation involves *the wilderness camp*.

# *Ant*. 3.262--264
“Similarly, it is prescribed by law for those who have buried the dead to associate with the community after \[seven days\]\.\.\.\. \[Moses\] banished lepers completely from the city—associating with no one and in no way differing from \[**the previously stated situation of**\] a corpse.”

# Sifre Num. 1:9
“There are three camps, the camp of Israel, the camp of the Levitical priests, and the camp of the Presence of God. From the gate of Jerusalem to the Temple mount is the camp of Israel, from the gate of the Temple mount to the Temple courtyard is the camp of the Levitical priesthood, and from the gate of the courtyard and inward is the camp of the Presence of God.”

## Two things to note:
* Exclusion of *lepra* is not permanent.
* Exclusion primarily applies to holy spaces, i.e., Jerusalem or possibly other walled cities.

<!--
* Josephus understands Moses's commands as applying in some way to "the city", but this isn't applicable to all communities everywhere.
    * Furthermore, the type of separation mentioned is specifically explained with reference to practices pertaining to corpse impurity, which involved temporary separation followed by purification.
* Sifre Numbers describes how the situation of the wilderness camp was mapped onto the post-conquest land of Israel, i.e., the "camps" translate into different zones within Jerusalem.
    * This view wasn't universal, since the Qumran sect, for example, viewed their community as a replacement for Jerusalem and thus subject to the same regulations.
* Further, m. Kelim 1:7 describes "walled cities" as subject to exclusion for those with *lepra* and corpses, but this would pertain to specific cities that had walls prior to the conquest.
* None of these situations apply to Jesus's interactions with lepers.

# Five common (and incorrect!) assertions about lepers
* Leprosy (modern-day *Hansen's disease*) was an incurable and severely disfiguring disease.
    * No. *Lepra* refers to non-fatal and seemingly temporary skin conditions.
* Leprosy was contagious and so contact with others was forbidden.
    * No. It is not a sin to become ritually impure through contact with *lepra*.
* Lepers were banished from public life and were forced to live outside cities and towns.
    * No. For many first century Jews, “the camp” refers to Jerusalem.
* Lepers could not participate in worship or religious life.
    * No. Contact with the temple was forbidden, but synagogues are not holy spaces.
* Exclusion was permanent unless certified by a priest.
    * No. Again, Jerusalem is primarily in view re: exclusion.

# Luke 5:12--14
“Once, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man covered with \[*lepra*\]. When he saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him, ‘Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean.’ Then Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, ‘I do choose. Be made clean.’ Immediately the \[*lepra*\] left him. And he ordered him to tell no one. ‘Go,’ he said, ‘and show yourself to the priest, and, as Moses commanded, make an offering for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.’”

<!--
* Note that Jesus is describes as being "in one of the cities" in Luke 5:12.
    * The idea that a man with *lepra* is approaching Jesus inside a city suggests that this man hasn't been ostracized from the city.
* The man's actual request is με καθαρίσαι, not to be "healed." The request is centered on purity rather than relief of a physical ailment.
* Jesus still tells the man to make the offering that is required in biblical law, i.e., the priest still has to assess the man's condition and determine his ritual status.
